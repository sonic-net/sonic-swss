"""
Test scenarios and related constants for dualtor neighbor miss.

Each item in NEIGH_MISS_TESTS is a test case, comprising of a list of steps.
Each step is a dictionary containing the action to be performed during that
step, as well as the expected result.
The expected result itself is another dictionary, containing the following
attributes:
    - (bool) EXPECT_ROUTE: if we expect a route entry in ASIC_DB
    - (bool) EXPECT_NEIGH: if we expect a neighbor entry in ASIC_DB
    - (bool) REAL_MAC: If a real MAC address is expected in the
                       APPL_DB neighbor table entry, as opposed
                       to a zero/empty MAC

All expected result attributes will be verified agains the DVS
after each test step is executed

Note: EXPECT_ROUTE and EXPECT_NEIGH cannot both be True

Note: for the purposes of this test, there is a distinction made
      between 'server' IPs and 'neighbor' IPs. Server IPs are
      IP addresses explicitly configured on a specific mux cable
      interface in the MUX_CABLE table in config DB. Neighbor IPs
      are any other IPs within the VLAN subnet.

# Note: For most test cases below, after the neighbor entry is deleted, we must
# still set `REAL_MAC` to `True` in the expected result since a prior step in the
# test should have resolved the neighbor entry and confirmed that the APPL_DB
# neighbor entry contained a real MAC address. Thus, when we verify that APPL_DB
# no longer contains a neighbor table entry, we need to check for the real MAC.
# The exception to this is test cases where the neighbor entry is never resolved
# in the kernel. In that case, APPL_DB will never contain the real MAC address.
